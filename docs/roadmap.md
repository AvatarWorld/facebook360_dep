Facebook360 Depth Estimation is a very young project. There are many ways in which it could improve and expand to cover more
use cases. Below is a non-exhaustive list of planned features that are just waiting on someone to have the spare cycles to implement!

- Quick stitch option enhancement
- Semantic segmentation in masking
- Machine learning based depth estimation
- LiDAR integration
