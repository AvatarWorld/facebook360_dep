# Contributing to facebook360_dep

Thank you for your interest in contributing to facebook360_dep! From commenting on and triaging issues, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are welcome. We aim to build a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem of partners, core contributors, and community that goes beyond the main facebook360_dep GitHub repository.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
* [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

### [Code of Conduct](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct/)

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct).

## Ways to Contribute

If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/facebook/facebook360_dep/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. As you gain more experience and demonstrate a commitment to evolving facebook360_dep, you may be granted issue management permissions in the repository.

There are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

1. **Replying and handling open issues.** Some issues may lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.
2. **Reviewing pull requests for the docs.** Reviewing [documentation updates](https://github.com/facebook/facebook360_dep/pulls) can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, click **Edit** at the top of most docs pages to get started with your own contribution.
3. **Help people write test plans.** Some pull requests sent to the main repository may lack a proper test plan. These help reviewers understand how the change was tested, and can speed up the time it takes for a contribution to be accepted.

Each of these tasks is highly impactful, and maintainers will greatly appreciate your help.

### Our Development Process

We use GitHub issues and pull requests to keep track of bug reports and contributions from the community. All changes from engineers at Facebook will sync to [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/facebook360_dep) through a bridge with Facebook's internal source control. Changes from the community are handled through GitHub pull requests. Once a change made on GitHub is approved, it will first be imported into Facebook's internal source control and tested against Facebook's codebase. Once merged at Facebook, the change will eventually sync back to GitHub as a single commit once it has passed Facebook's internal tests.


### Security Bugs

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need

## Contributing Code

Code-level contributions to facebook360_dep generally come in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). The process of proposing a change to facebook360_dep can be summarized as follows:

1. Fork the facebook360_dep repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
5. Make sure your code lints (for example via https://github.com/python/black for Python).
6. Push the changes to your fork.
7. Create a pull request to the facebook360_dep repository.
8. Review and address comments on your pull request.
    1. A bot may comment with suggestions. Generally we ask you to resolve these first before a maintainer will review your code.
9. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
